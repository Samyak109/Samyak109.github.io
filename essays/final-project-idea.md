# Overview
In the University of Hawaii at Manoa student body, activities such as Cram Jam and other student events are readily featured. But a capability that focuses on academics which enables students to easily find study buddies to specific subjects has yet to be possible. Thus to address this situation, a possible solution may be to create a hub where students may communicate and search for other classmates called Study Buddies. For this application, the audience is structured to all students on the campus, including professors and facuility. 
# Mockup Page Ideas
-	Public landing page (home page)
-	Login page
-	Individual home page
-	Admin home page
-	Specific course page
-	Browse study groups
# Use case ideas
-	New users can go straight to a login page, after logging in, the user is presented with his/her dashboard and homepage. From there the user can setup their profile and add courses and desired study groups.
-	Admin pages would also have a login page with credentials, able to login to a special admin site, unique admin homepage, and be able to edit parts of the site.
-	Normal users go to the dashboard after logging in and are able to search for clubs of interest.
-	Team pages involving all the people interested in studying together for that class.
-	Dashboard has calendar to let users see signed up study sessions.
# Beyond the Basics
-	Ability to create and propose pages, need to be confirmed by admin.
-	Notifications and reminders for upcoming study sessions.
-	Site-wide refresher to remove study groups every semester.
-	Search ability for specific classes, sections, topics, and interests. Ability to search for specific study group names.
-	Private study groups not available to the public without invitation. 
-	Users have flags and report features.
-	Admins have ability to remove inappropriate groups.
