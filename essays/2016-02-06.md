In a sense, programmer’s block is simlar to writer’s block where “A writer may run out of inspiration, or be distracted by other events”. In contrast to writer’s block, however, programmer’s block occurs when a developer or engineer has too many ideas and is distracted by attempting to design and implement all of the ideas into his/her design. The ability to create and manipulate one’s limitless imagination enables developers and engineers in this intriguing field to bring fantasy to life. Nowadays, developers have free and easy access to more tools, methodologies, and techniques than in the past as the open source community is a perfect example of this endless span of information. 
The infinite amount of ideas which can be implemented and showcased to the world is what lured me into this lucrative world of text, brackets, and semicolons. Studying software enginerring has opened my eye to the world around me and has heightened my curosity of the endless possibilities of programming. One of the biggest differences between software development compared to other fields is the highly-iterable nature of the work. Tools and work flows have evolved to take advantage of this method of implementing new features. The capability to transform text into seemingly magical programs that enable a culture of knowledge, innovation, and collaboration among the community influenced me to study software enginerring. With the ability to make an impact through ideas, the possibility to educate others about techonology, and most importantly, the capacability to build techonology for good causes, I hope one day I’ll be able to use my postion and knowledge to make a positive impact in my community and in the world. 
As I move forward, my long-term goal is the expand my knowledge and obtain hands-on-experience in the areas of embedded programming and artifical intellegence. I believe this growing subsection of software enginering has limitless possibility to positively impact the lives of others. With new innovative techonlogy becoming increasingly relevant and even a necesseity in our everyday lives, I hope to build software to improve the lives of everyday people. But that’s the dream in the future. As of now, perhaps there are now too many ideas, and too many projects to implement. As opposed to not knowing what to write in writer’s block, a delema comes where there are too many projects to puruse and not enough focus. Although there may be too many ideas, I’ll just stick with one idea at a time. As always, just build it.
